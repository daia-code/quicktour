        <h4>Hello quickwalkers,</h4>
        <p>Quick Tour is a web app, friendly and intuitive for every user. The application aims to satisfy tourists who visit the most beautiful cities of Romania. </p>
        <p>This compared to the other applications keeps tourists up to date with the best tourist attractions, places to relax and accommodation for any budget. At the same time, it makes known the best places to have a traditional or international meal. To be able to fix the mobility problem, it connects with the moovit transport application.</p>
        <h3>Our story</h3>
        <p>Quicktour was an idea presented at Techstars Startup Weekend Oradea. Although it was not very successful in the contest, I was not disappointed. As they say, it could be worse, I didn't go home with 0 votes.</p>
